# Prisma Access Service Setup Configuration

This skillet is run after the plug-in is installed and licensed and before any mobile user or
remote network onboarding.

Configuration elements include:

* Prisma Access service subnet
* Infrastructure BGP AS
* Base template, template-stack, and device-group configuration

This is a one time configuration for a new Panorama install.
